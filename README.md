# Employee-Management-System

Employee Management System (EMS)  The Employee Management System (EMS) is a full-stack web application designed to streamline employee and department management within a company. It allows admins to manage employees, departments, and leave requests, while employees can view their profiles, apply for leave, and track their leave history. The system uses a REST API architecture for communication between the frontend and backend.  Key Features:  Admin: Add, edit, delete, and view employees, departments, and leaves.  Employee: View personal profile, apply for leave, and check leave status/history.  Authentication: Secure login/logout with role-based access (admin or employee).  Simple UI: Minimal interface with text boxes, buttons, and tables for easy interaction.  Tech Stack:  Frontend: React.js with Axios for API calls  Backend: Laravel 10 REST API with Sanctum for authentication  Database: MySQL  Optional: Email notifications (SMTP/Mailtrap)  Database Design:  users – authentication and roles  departments – department details  employees – employee profiles linked to users and departments  leaves – leave requests with status tracking  Backend API Endpoints:  Authentication: /api/register, /api/login, /api/logout  Departments: CRUD operations (/api/departments)  Employees: CRUD operations (/api/employees)  Leaves: CRUD operations (/api/leaves)  Frontend Structure:  LoginPage: Login form for authentication  AdminDashboard: Employee, department, and leave management tables with CRUD buttons  EmployeeDashboard: Profile view, leave request form, and leave history table  Forms: EmployeeForm, DepartmentForm, LeaveForm for input and validation  Highlights:  API-based communication ensures separation of concerns between frontend and backend.  Minimal UI focuses on functionality; styling can be added later.  Prepared for future CI/CD integration to automate testing and deployment.
